### Project Description
The IBM Telco Customer Churn dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains data on 7,043 fictitious telecommunications customers and 21 features, in addition to the binary target variable “Churn” indicating whether a customer left within the past month (“Yes” or “No”). Each row represents a single customer and includes information about the services they use (phone service, multiple lines, internet service, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies); account details (tenure, contract type, payment method, paperless billing status, monthly charges, and total charges); and demographic attributes (gender, age range, and whether they have a partner or dependents). These factors can be used to predict which customers are likely to churn.
